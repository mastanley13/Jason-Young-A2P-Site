Please see my office site below.  Itâ€™s very basic and I simply need something functional with only a few pages (Main landing page, Contact Us page, Privacy Policy page, Terms of Service page)

For now, I simply need it to be compliant for the 10DLC/A2P approval.

The requirements for the Terms of Service page and Privacy policy pages that GHL support gave me are below.  Also, if you could mirror my current Contact Us page, it includes all the stuff needed.

Also, the privacy and terms of service links need to be static on the bottom of each website page. 

Finally, the privacy policy and terms of service links must be present in the body of the contact us page.

Terms of Service Requirements

At minimum, your terms and conditions will need to have the boilerplate statement
{Insert program description here; a brief description of the types of messages users can expect upon opting in.}
You can cancel the SMS service at any time. Simply text "STOP" to the shortcode. Upon sending "STOP," we will confirm your unsubscribe status via SMS. Following this confirmation, you will no longer receive SMS messages from us. To rejoin, sign up as you did initially, and we will resume sending SMS messages to you.
If you experience issues with the messaging program, reply with the keyword HELP for more assistance, or reach out directly to {support email address or toll-free number}.
Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
As always, message and data rates may apply for messages sent to you from us and to us from you. Message frequency varies. For questions about your text plan or data plan, contact your wireless provider.
For privacy-related inquiries, please refer to our privacy policy: {link to privacy policy}.
 

Privacy Policy Requirements

Please note that a compliant Privacy Policy must state that:
"No mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates for marketing/promotional purposes. Information sharing to subcontractors in support services, such as customer service is permitted. All other use case categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties."
